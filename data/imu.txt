Imu is the supreme ruler of the World Government, who occupies the Empty Throne and whom even the Five Elders bow to and serve unquestioningly.[2] However, Imu's existence is kept an absolute secret within the government and from the world at large, to maintain the lie that there is no singular ruler of the world.[3]  Imu is revealed and first appears during the Levely Arc. Due to their status and indirect actions, they are one of the main antagonists in the Final Saga and one of the primary overarching antagonists of the One Piece series as a whole.
