Emet,[2] also known as the Iron Giant, is a legendary robot that attacked Mary Geoise 200 years ago. It was originally created 900 years ago, around the time of the Void Century where it was a friend of Joy Boy, for a yet unknown purpose. It was inactive due to running out of energy and is kept on Egghead.[1][3] After hearing the Drums of Liberation from Monkey D. Luffy, Emet powered back up,[4] during which it guarded Vegapunk's prerecorded video being broadcasted from within itself.[5]  It is an ally of the Straw Hat Pirates during the Egghead Arc.
