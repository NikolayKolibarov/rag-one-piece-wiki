Donquixote Doflamingo,[4] nicknamed "Heavenly Yaksha",[9] is the captain of the Donquixote Pirates.[14] Prior to his imprisonment[15], he was a member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea with a frozen bounty of Beli340,000,000,[16] as well as the most influential underworld broker under the codename "Joker".[8][2] He is also a former World Noble, descended from the Donquixote Family.[6]  He is the first son of the late Donquixote Homing[17] and the older brother of the late Rosinante,[18] both of whom he killed out of feeling betrayed by them.[19][18] Doflamingo became the King of Dressrosa after taking the throne from Riku Doldo III eight years before the start of the series.[20] He ruled the country tyrannically until he was stripped of his positions as a Warlord of the Sea and king after he was defeated by Monkey D. Luffy near the end of the Dressrosa Arc. After Doflamingo was arrested by Admiral Fujitora along with most of his crew,[21] he was locked up at Impel Down and placed in Level 6.[22] Vegapunk later cloned Doflamingo as one of the Seraphim to replace the Warlords.[23]  Doflamingo is first introduced during the Skypiea Saga, having a minor role during its epilogue as Bellamy's superior. He is also a major antagonist in the Marineford Arc where he took part in the Summit War of Marineford and sided with the Marines, along with most of the other Warlords of the Sea, and the main antagonist of the Dressrosa Arc and the Dressrosa Saga as a whole, being the impetus for the entirety of the saga's events.[2]
